# ðŸ–§ Simple LAN & Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) Simulation

## ðŸ”¹ Aim
To construct a simple LAN using Cisco Packet Tracer and understand the concept and operation of Address Resolution Protocol (ARP).

---

## ðŸ”¹ Problem Statement
Computers in a LAN communicate using IP addresses, but data is delivered through MAC addresses.  
Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is required to map IP addresses to MAC addresses.  
This project demonstrates ARP operation in a simple LAN using Cisco Packet Tracer.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Scope of the Solution
- Demonstrates ARP functionality in a LAN environment.  
- Explains how devices identify each other via IPâ€“MAC mapping.  
- Useful for IoT and industrial networking applications.  
- Helps students understand how communication works inside a LAN.

## ðŸ”¹ Required Components
**Software / IDE:**
- Cisco Packet Tracer (Network Simulator)

**Hardware (Virtual in Packet Tracer):**
- 1 Ã— Switch (Cisco 2960, 8-port)  
- 3 Ã— PCs  
- 3 Ã— Copper Straight-Through Cables
